# AIProject

In this project we implemented the A* Algorithm while using the misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance heuristic,
the Breadth-first search algorithm and the Iterative deepening A* with the heuristic of the misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance,
to solve an n-sliding puzzle where you choose the n value.

We also added a graphical user interface using JavaFX, to run the code please visit the class MainApplication and run the code.

The graphical user interface may bug if you try to change the n value after generating one, if that happens just close and restart the application.

Project made by Anthony Homsy, Guillem Martinez and Taha Fakhran.
